# Data Processing Challenge

## Objective
Create a data processing pipeline that reads from a CSV file, performs transformations, and outputs the results in both JSON and SQL formats.

## Requirements
1. Create a Python module that:
   - Reads a CSV file containing user data (name, email, age, signup_date)
   - Validates the data (proper email format, age > 0, valid date)
   - Transforms the data (capitalize names, standardize dates)
   - Outputs the processed data in both JSON and SQL insert statements

2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Write unit tests for your validation and transformation functions
4. Use Python type hints and follow PEP 8 guidelines

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code organization and modularity
- Error handling and input validation
- Test coverage and quality
- Documentation and code comments
- Performance considerations
